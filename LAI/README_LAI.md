# LAI Data

This folder contains both **raw** and **processed** data from **Leaf Area Index (LAI)** measurements taken in the field, alongside the spectral and LWP measurements.

---

## ⚠️ Data Quality Notice

Due to poor planning of the measurement procedure, the resulting LAI values were found to be **unreliable** and were **not used in the final analysis**.

Nevertheless, the data is preserved here for transparency and documentation purposes.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `raw/` – contains the original LAI measurements
- `processed/` – contains two different processing attempts:
  - The **second attempt** is likely more accurate, as it uses an improved calibration procedure in the **FV2200** software

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

- A separate file in this folder explains **how to apply the FV2200 calibration** used in the second processing attempt.
