# Yishi Project Archive

This folder contains the data and code collected and developed during the **Yishi Project**.  
The project aimed to model **Leaf Water Potential (LWP)** in a mixed Mediterranean forest, detect drought effects, and predict these effects at the plot level using **remote sensing tools**.

For more details about the project, please refer to the papers available in the [`Outputs_and_Presentation`](/Outputs_and_Presentations/Publications/Published_Papers) folder.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The directory is organized by data type:

- `Spectral data`
- `LWP measurements`
- `LAI (Leaf Area Index)`
- `Gas exchange data`
- `SWC (Soil Water Content)`
- `Outputs and presentation` – project results and public materials

## 📦 Contents of Each Folder

Inside each subfolder, you will typically find:

- `Raw data`
- `Processed data`
- `Python scripts` used for data processing and visualization

## ⚠️ Note on Spectral Data

As mentioned in the README file of the **Spectral Data** folder:  
Raw imagery acquired by **drone** and the **VENµS satellite** is **not included** here due to large file sizes.  
These datasets are stored on the **Givat Ram cloud server**.

👉 For access details, please refer to the [Spectral Data README](/Spectral_Data/README_Spetral_Data.md).
